  "extractedText": "1. What is photosynthesis?\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which green plants prepare their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Chlorophyll present in the leaves helps in absorbing sunlight for this process.\n\n2. Name the cell organelle known as the “powerhouse of the cell”.\n\nMitochondria is known as the powerhouse of the cell because it produces energy in the form of ATP.\n\n3. What is the basic unit of heredity?\n\nThe basic unit of heredity is chromosome.\n(partially wrong – expected: gene)\n\n4. Define osmosis.\n\nOsmosis is the movement of water molecules from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration through a semipermeable membrane.\n\n5. Which blood cells help in clotting of blood?\n\nRed blood cells help in clotting of blood.\n(wrong – expected: platelets)\n\n6. What is the function of ribosomes?\n\nRibosomes help in the synthesis of proteins in the cell.\n\n7. Name the plant hormone responsible for growth of stem.\n\nAuxin is responsible for the growth of stem in plants.\n\n8. What is respiration?\n\nRespiration is the process of breaking down food to release energy for various life processes.\n\n9. Name the pigment present in red blood cells.\nHemoglobin is the pigment present in red blood cells.\n\n10. What is meant by biodiversity?\nBiodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms present in a particular area.\n\n11. Which part of the brain controls balance of the body?\nCerebellum controls balance and posture of the body.\n\n12. Define ecology.\nEcology is the study of interaction between living organisms and their environment.\n\n13. What is DNA?\nDNA is Deoxyribonucleic Acid which carries genetic information from parents to offspring.\n\n14. Name the respiratory organ in fish.\nFish respire using lungs.\n(wrong – expected: gills)\n\n15. What is vaccination?\nVaccination is the process of introducing weakened or dead pathogens into the body to develop immunity against diseases.\n\n16. Which gas is released during photosynthesis?\nCarbon dioxide is released during photosynthesis.\n(wrong – expected: oxygen)\n\n17. What is the role of insulin hormone?\n(no answer written - left blank)\n\n18. Name the scientist who proposed the theory of evolution.\nCharles Darwin proposed the theory of evolution.\n\n19. What is an ecosystem?\nAn ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with non-living components of the environment.\n\n20. Define genetics.\nGenetics is the branch of biology that deals with heredity and variation.",
